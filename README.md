In order to run initially to install node dependencies (such as all the stuff for create-react-app and gh-pages modules)

npm install

if you want to start the app locally run

npm run start

in order to deploy to github pages run command

npm run deploy

it will upload the state of repo to (default) "gh-pages" branch. It should be available under https://team-osocze.github.io/ url within ~2 minutes (more or less). You may receive github auth prompt window - don't stare into terminal for that :D.
